# Bike-Sales-Analysis
Excel-Powered Insights into Bike Sales Dynamics


<h1>Introduction:</h1>
During my learning process for Excel tutorials for data analysts playlist on youtube that is uploaded on <STRONG>Alex The Analyst channel</STRONG>,My interest was piqued by a dataset generously provided by Alex Freberg.This dataset encapsulates crucial information about bike purchasers, ranging from their income and commute distance to age brackets, occupational breakdown, and marital status. 


<h1>Methodology:</h1>
In this project, I undertook a series of essential steps, each playing a crucial role in the data analysis process:

<ol>
            <li>üîÑ Understanding the Data: Unveiled the details of the dataset, decoding its structure and nuances.</li>
            <li>üßπ Cleaning the Data: Applied cleaning techniques to ensure data accuracy and reliability.</li>
            <li>üìÜ Age Bracket Customization: Developed custom columns to categorize data into insightful age brackets.</li>
            <li>üìä Pivot Tables, Charts, and Graphs: Leveraged Excel's capabilities to create dynamic visualizations, transforming raw data into meaningful insights.</li>
            <li>üìà Dashboard Creation: Integrated these visual elements into a cohesive dashboard, utilizing slicers for interactive exploration. This feature empowers users to interpret the data in diverse ways, enhancing the overall analytical experience.</li>

<h1>Unmasking Bike Sales Patterns: Key Findings üîç:</h1>

<ol>
            <li><strong>Gender Disparity in Income and Purchases:</strong> Males exhibit a higher average income compared to females. Male customers demonstrate a higher purchase rate of bicycles.</li>
            <li><strong>Commuting Distance Impact:</strong> Commuting distance is a decisive factor in bike purchases. For distances less than 1 mile, a total of 366 bicycles were purchased. Commutes of 10 miles or more resulted in 111 bicycle purchases.</li>
            <li><string>Age Dynamics in Bike Sales:</string> Middle-aged customers dominate bicycle purchases, with a total of 701 bikes. Adolescents and older individuals show comparatively lower purchase numbers.</li>
        </ol>


<h1>The Analysis:</h1>
- In exploring the data, my initial question revolved around <strong>the impact of income on bicycle purchases</strong>. To decipher this correlation, I utilized Excel's capabilities to construct a pivot table, highlighting the average income for customers who made a purchase and those who did not, segmented by gender. <storng>Notably, the findings underscored a trend where, on average, males tend to have higher incomes, contributing to their increased likelihood of purchasing bicycles</storng>.

- Following that, I directed my attention toward determining <strong>the age brackets with the highest rates of bicycle purchases</strong>. And it's noted tha <strong>the Middle Age bracket has the highest number of purchases, by far.</strong>

- Finally, I delved into understanding <strong>the distances customers are willing to commute </strong>for a bicycle purchase, a pivotal aspect for the business.The data unmistakably indicates that <strong>customers who travel the shortest distances are more inclined to purchase bikes.</strong>

- Finally, I crafted an Excel-powered dashboard incorporating pivot charts along with the addition of slicers. This functionality enables the breakdown of data by <strong>marital status, region, and education levels</strong>. The resulting dashboard serves as a robust tool for decision-makers, offering actionable insights into customer behavior, preferences, and demographic trends. Ultimately, it contributes to the formulation of well-informed business strategies in the realm of bike sales.
